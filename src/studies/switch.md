pico: In adults with spontaneous deep intracerebral hemorrhage, does decompressive craniectomy improve functional outcomes at 180 days when compared to standard medical management?

gist: |
  The SWITCH trial investigated the role of decompressive craniectomy (DC) for severe, deep-seated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a form of stroke associated with high mortality. Patients were randomized to DC plus best medical treatment or medical treatment alone. The trial was unfortunately stopped early due to lack of funding, which limited its statistical power to reach a definitive conclusion. Despite this limitation, the study provided weak evidence suggesting DC might be superior, with a potential absolute risk reduction of death or profound disability by 13% at 180 days. While not definitive, the findings contribute to the debate on DC's potential benefit in this devastating patient population.

## Background and Clinical Context

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe form of stroke with high rates of mortality and disability. Deep-seated ICH, particularly in regions like the basal ganglia and thalamus, often leads to significant neurological deficits due to the critical functions these areas serve. The management of deep ICH remains controversial, with limited evidence supporting surgical interventions. Decompressive craniectomy (DC) has been proposed as a potential treatment to alleviate intracranial pressure and prevent secondary brain injury, but its efficacy in deep ICH has not been well established.

## Patient Population

The SWITCH trial enrolled adult patients with spontaneous deep supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage who were deemed suitable candidates for decompressive craniectomy. Inclusion criteria likely focused on patients with significant hematoma volume and neurological impairment, while excluding those with contraindications to surgery or poor baseline functional status.

## Study Design

The SWITCH trial was a randomized controlled trial comparing decompressive craniectomy plus best medical treatment to best medical treatment alone in patients with deep ICH. The primary outcome was functional status at 180 days, typically measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary outcomes likely included mortality rates, neurological improvement, and adverse events related to surgery.

## Results

The trial was terminated early due to funding constraints, which limited its ability to draw definitive conclusions. However, preliminary results suggested a trend towards improved outcomes in the DC group, with an estimated absolute risk reduction of death or profound disability by 13% at 180 days. The findings, while not statistically robust due to the early termination, indicated a potential benefit of DC in this patient population.

## Online Discussion and Expert Commentary

The SWITCH trial has sparked considerable discussion within the neurosurgical and stroke communities. Experts have highlighted the challenges of conducting surgical trials in acute stroke settings, particularly regarding patient selection and timing of intervention. Some commentators have noted that while the results are not definitive, they provide a rationale for further investigation into DC for deep ICH. The trial's early termination has been viewed as a missed opportunity to clarify the role of surgery in this context, underscoring the need for sustained funding and support for clinical research in stroke care.

## Implications for Clinical Practice

The SWITCH trial adds to the growing body of literature exploring surgical interventions for ICH. Although the early termination limits the strength of the conclusions, the observed trend towards benefit with decompressive craniectomy suggests that further research is warranted. Clinicians should consider the potential risks and benefits of DC on a case-by-case basis, taking into account patient-specific factors such as hematoma size, location, and overall health status. Future larger-scale trials are needed to definitively establish the role of DC in managing deep ICH and to identify which patients may derive the most benefit from this intervention.
