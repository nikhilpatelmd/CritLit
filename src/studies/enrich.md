pico: In patients with supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage, does early minimally-invasive hematoma evacuation improve functional outcomes at 180 days when compared to standard medical management?

gist: |
  The ENRICH trial attempted the address the long-standing question of surgical benefit in ICH patients by testing a novel, early minimally invasive approach (MIPS). This randomized, adaptive trial compared MIPS plus medical management to medical management alone in patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH (volume 30-80 mL). MIPS resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale score at 180 days, driven primarily by the benefit observed in patients with lobar hemorrhages. The trial demonstrated that early (<24 hours) minimally invasive clot removal can improve functional outcomes, suggesting a transformative shift in the treatment paradigm for a specific subgroup of ICH.
